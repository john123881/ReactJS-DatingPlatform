## üìã Description

This Repo is a course exercise topic. (iSpan front-end engineer development course, final topic.)

The topic is Date in Taipei, which focuses on matching and making friends, using the same interests in bars and movies to find new friends, while social software and itinerary planning are supplemented to arrange date itineraries.

The functions I am responsible for include: member login/registration, password forget, member profile, game (Snake), and favorites center.

The front-end uses Next.js to build the website, the back-end uses Express.js to create the API, and the database uses MySQL. The above technologies are used to complete a website platform.
